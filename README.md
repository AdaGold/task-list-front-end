# Task List React Livecode

In this livecode, we will be working with state & events in React.  Then we will use the `useEffect` hook to update state from an API and persist state to an API with events.

## Learning Goals

The goals of this live code are to:

- Gain an ability to use State in a React component and pass information to other components via props
- Use the `useEffect` hook to update state after the component first mounts
- Use `axios` to make API calls to update state
- Write controlled form components

- Part 1: Components, Props, and State
    - [Wave 01: Components and Props](./project-docs/wave-01.md)
    - [Wave 02: State and Event Handling](./project-docs/wave-02.md)
    - [Wave 03:  Lifting state up](./project-docs/wave-03.md)
- Part 2: Connecting to the Task List API
    - [Wave 04:  useEffect And Axios](./project-docs/wave-04.md)
    - [Wave 05: Adding a Form](./project-docs/wave-05.md)

## Notes on Tests

We have added tests to the project for students to investigate at their own discretion.  They are not required to understand or learn about lifting state, useEffect, APIs or controlled forms.

# Task List Front End
In this pair project, we will be working with state & events in React.  Then we will use the `useEffect` hook to update state from an API and persist state to an API with events.

## Learning Goals

The goals of this pair project are to:

- Gain an ability to use State in a React component and pass information to other components via props
- Use the `useEffect` hook to update state after the component first mounts
- Use `axios` to make API calls to update state
- Write controlled form components


## Project Directions

- Part 1: React Components, Props, State and Event Handling
    - [Wave 01: Setup and Baseline](./project-docs/wave-01.md)
    - [Wave 02: Lifting Up State](./project-docs/wave-02.md)
- Part 2: Connecting to the Task List API
    - [Wave 03: useEffect And Axios](./project-docs/wave-03.md)
    - [Wave 04: Handling Forms](./project-docs/wave-04.md)

## Notes on Tests

We have added tests to the project for students to investigate at their own discretion.  They are not required to understand or learn about lifting state, useEffect, APIs or controlled forms.
